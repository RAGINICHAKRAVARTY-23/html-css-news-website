This repository contains the source code for a news website created as part of my web development learning journey. The project focuses on building a structured, readable, and logically organized news platform using core web development concepts. While the website is developed at a beginner level, it follows correct practices in layout organization, content structuring, and semantic HTML, making it useful both as a learning project and as a reference for others.

The purpose of this project is to practice how real-world websites like news portals are structured, including sections for headlines, articles, categories, and readable content flow. Special attention has been given to clarity, hierarchy, and proper use of HTML elements so that the content remains accessible and easy to understand.
