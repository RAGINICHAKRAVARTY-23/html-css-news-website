    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Indian stock market has shown strong bullish momentum heading into November 2025, fueled by robust domestic economic growth and healthy Q2 corporate earnings. Key indices like the Nifty surged 4.51% and the Sensex climbed 4.57% in October, marking one of the best monthly performances of the year. The rally was driven by sectors such as PSU banks, metals, automobiles, and FMCG, buoyed by declining crude oil prices, strong festive demand, and optimism about the rollout of GST 2.0. The Bank Nifty reached record highs, reflecting confidence in financial sector growth supported by stable interest rates and improved credit demand. Market sentiment has also benefited from improving India–U.S. trade relations and advances in bilateral cooperation on technology and manufacturing. However, analysts caution that the market’s near-term trajectory will depend on factors including global crude oil prices, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy stance, and the outcome of important state elections such as Bihar. Despite some volatility risk, the strong macroeconomic fundamentals and renewed investor confidence suggest that the Indian equity markets could maintain an upward bias as the festive season progresses, making it an attractive environment for long-term investors and sector leader.</p>
