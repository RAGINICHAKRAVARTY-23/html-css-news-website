  <h1><u>Donald Trump Signs Bill to End Longest U.S. Government Shutdown After 43 Days, Restoring Federal Services Nationwide</u></h1>
</header>
<main>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">One of the top international news stories as of November 2025 is the signing of a bill by former U.S. President Donald Trump that ended the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which lasted 43 days. The shutdown caused widespread disruptions, including unpaid government workers, canceled flights, and suspended food aid programs for millions. This bill reopened the federal government and reinstated funding, bringing relief to hundreds of thousands of affected employees and restoring normal government services. Meanwhile, on the global front, Pakistan suspended mobile internet services in Balochistan due to security concerns, Israel reopened the Zikim crossing to allow humanitarian aid into northern Gaza after months of blockade, and France marked the 10th anniversary of the deadly Paris attacks with renewed vigilance. Additionally, a major fire damaged the historic Yongqing Temple in China, and an earthquake struck Afghanistan recently, adding to the global list of pressing issues.</p>
